This paper describes a notional use case where an _ad hoc_ collection is invoked and the status messages signaling its completion trigger a corresponding _ad hoc_ evaluation of the newly collected data. This approach includes use of the currently undefined OpenC2 `notification` message type. The PACE project provides excellent use cases for substantiating the need for this message type.
